## 1. Executive Summary & Value Proposition

| Dimension | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Project Name** | **BeU NextGen** |
| **Core Question** | *"Can I afford this right now without hurting my future self?"* |
| **Target Audience** | Malaysian university students and young adults (Gen Z). |
| **Core Problem** | Traditional finance apps present a single total balance. This hides upcoming bills, commitments, and savings goals, leading to mental guesswork and end-of-month financial stress. |
| **The Solution** | BeU NextGen separates money into what the user has, what must be protected (commitments), and what can be safely spent. It leverages gamified streaks, product-linked tiers, and localized AI coaches to build sustainable money habits. |

## 2. Core Feature & Mechanics Matrix

This table summarizes the core features of the system, including the current features and the newly proposed gamification additions.

| Feature Area | Component Name | Description & Mechanics | Strategic/Hackathon Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financial Guardrails** | **Safe Daily Spend** | Dynamically calculates the exact spendable limit per day based on allowance, days remaining in the cycle, and locked commitments. | Replaces mental budget guesswork with a clear, active daily limit. |
| | **Smart Bill Lock** | Allows users to lock their critical recurring expenses (rent, PTPTN, phone, transport) in automated, protected envelopes. | Protects users from accidentally spending money reserved for essential bills. |
| | **Resilience Score** | A weighted health indicator ($50\%$ Cashflow, $30\%$ Debt/Commitment Health, $20\%$ Savings Progress) that tracks overall financial safety. | Evaluates financial health in real-time instead of just looking at raw balance. |
| **Gamified Discipline (New)** | **TikTok-Style Streaks** | A "Save-Not-Spend" engine. Stays under the *Safe Daily Spend* limit = $+1$ streak day. Overspending resets the streak to 0. | Boosts UI/UX Polish and gamification scores by aligning with daily youth social patterns. |
| | **Visual Dashboard Cues** | Pulsing fire emoji (`🔥 X Days`) next to the cashflow tracker. The BeU Pet companion reacts dynamically (happy on streaks, sad/angry on breakage). | Maximizes evaluation points for intuitive, user-centered UI/UX and micro-animations. |
| | **Zus Coffee-Style Tiers** | A 3-tiered reward system based on streak milestones (Bronze, Silver, Gold) tracked in the global Zustand state. | Demonstrates technical implementation depth beyond superficial mockups. |

## 3. Bank Islam Campaign & Real-World Product Integration

To address the **Business Model & Viability (15%)** and **Track Alignment (10%)** hackathon criteria, the system maps user loyalty tiers directly to real-world Bank Islam campaigns and transition strategies.

| Tier Level | Tier Milestone | Actual Bank Islam Product Integration | App Execution & Simulated Rewards |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Bronze Budgeter** | **Base Level**<br>*(0–6 Day Streak)* | Baseline access to the **4 AI Council Agents** | Default entry level. Standard interaction with savings and expense analysis tools (*Savings Sentinel, Debt Shield, Growth Guru, Finance Strategist*). |
| **2. Silver Saver** | **Maintain 7-Day Streak** | **Be U Awfar Account** & *"Nest"* Savings Pockets | Triggers automated prompts to move daily unspent capital into an *Awfar Nest*. Links to Bank Islam’s **RM15 Million Draw** (Porsche Taycan / BMW i4 prizes) and unlocks localized merchant partner rewards (e.g., **RM5 OFF Grab** or **10% OFF Koppiku**). |
| **3. Gold Guardian** | **Maintain 30-Day Streak** | **Be U Term Deposit-i (TD-i)** / **MaxCash 2026 Campaign** | Unlocks simulated access to the premium **BeU MaxCash Hybrid Engine**. Calculates optimization metrics for placing RM1,000 of idle cash into fixed returns and applies a premium compound rate modifier (boosting from $6.5\%$ to $7.0\%$ p.a.) to Growth Starter pockets. |

## 4. Viral Social Campaign: `#MisiBIMBTransition`

Given Bank Islam's transition of Be U into the main BIMB Mobile app by **July 31, 2026**, this feature addresses user retention and customer acquisition during this migration.

| Campaign Component | Operational Action Workflow | Business & Structural Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Macro Hook** | Capture the major event of Be U app decommissioning on July 31, 2026, transitioning users smoothly to the main BIMB Mobile app. | Proves Business Model & Viability by actively retaining youth users through the real-world platform transition phase. |
| **The Trend Theme** | **"Graduation From Broke"** / **`#MisiBIMBTransition`** Challenge (Inspired by the real Be U Savings Streak `#MisiPuasaRaya` challenge). | Speaks directly to the judges' focus on localized, youth-centered social challenges. |
| **"Share My Roast" Button** | Placed in the **Pay Scanner** (`/scan`) and **AI Coach** (`/coach`) panels. Exports a hilariously savage Malay/Manglish financial de-influencing roast. | Converts witty, localized app content into an organic, loop-based viral customer acquisition tool. |
| **Canvas Generation** | Programmatically compiles a mobile-friendly graphic containing the current BeU Pet asset, the custom AI roast text, user streak data, and an application download QR code. | Leverages the hosting environment to dynamically serve real-time download targets. |
| **The Virality Incentive** | Sharing the generated "Financial Passport" graphic grants the user a **24-hour "Streak Shield"** (protects streak from breaking for one day) + a simulated **RM10 Referral Bonus** loop. | Matches Bank Islam’s real-world referral strategy to create realistic customer retention loops. |

## 5. Technical Blueprint & Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 5.1 Functional Requirements (FR)

| Requirement ID | Technical Module | Functional Specification (What It Must Do) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SR-1.1** | **Streak Tracking** | Must monitor daily discretionary transaction inputs against the calculated *Safe Daily Spend* threshold. |
| **SR-1.2** | **Increment Logic** | At 11:59 PM (simulated), if total daily expenditure $\le$ *Safe Daily Spend*, the global state variable `currentStreak` increments by $+1$. |
| **SR-1.3** | **Reset Logic** | If daily spend exceeds *Safe Daily Spend*, `currentStreak` drops to 0. Updates pet companion state to sad or angry. |
| **SR-1.4** | **Streak Shield** | Provides an interface once a week to consume a "Streak Shield" earned via social media sharing to prevent status decay. |
| **SR-2.1** | **Tier Computation** | Evaluates user loyalty tiers dynamically (`Bronze` $\to$ `Silver` $\to$ `Gold`) inside the state engine backend whenever store states update. |
| **SR-3.1** | **Roast Export** | Renders a high-visibility canvas export action button immediately after the local dialect generation sequence completes in the AI Coach or Scanner. |
| **SR-3.2** | **Referral Loop** | QR code targets must accept inbound parameters during onboarding (`/setup`), triggering a dual credit configuration hook (simulating the RM10 reward). |

### 5.2 Technical & Data Requirements

| Layer | System Target | Implementation Specification (How It Works Under the Hood) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zustand State** | **`useStore.ts` Extension** | Extend global TypeScript interfaces to track: `currentStreak: number`, `highestStreak: number`, `lastCalculatedDate: string` (to avoid double-calculation), `membershipTier: 'Bronze' \| 'Silver' \| 'Gold'`, `streakShieldActive: boolean`, `awfarDrawTickets: number`, and `isBimbMigrated: boolean`. |
| **Data Sync** | **Local & Cloud Sync** | Support persistent local state sync (via Zustand middleware) and define a mock sync schema (`POST /api/user/sync`) to commit streak datasets. |
| **Security Layer** | **API Key Orchestration** | Ensure sensitive keys (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) are accessed via server-side routing endpoints/proxies rather than exposed in client-side bundles. |

### 5.3 UI/UX & Visual Requirements

| UI Element | Animation Framework | Visual Specification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Streak Tracker** | **Tailwind CSS / Framer Motion** | Highly visible, pulsing fire emoji component directly embedded inside the main interactive command dashboard view (`🔥 X Days`). |
| **Tier Status Change** | **Framer Motion** | Fullscreen, celebratory card flip animation detailing the unlocked Bank Islam product integrations when user graduates to a new tier. |
| **BeU Pet Reactions** | **Framer Motion / CSS Sprites** | Intercepts state changes immediately: triggers excited/cheering animation loops on successful daily closures, and think states when computing yields. |

## 6. Pitch Positioning Strategy for Judges

Wafi, Akmal, Paan, and Ibad can present the gamified expansion during evaluation using this positioning framework:

| Pitch Angle | What Traditional Teams Will Say | What BeU NextGen Proves to Bank Islam Executives |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Retention** | *"We built an app to teach students how to save money through generic data charts."* | *"Our streak engine turns the stressful July 31st app migration phase into a gamified milestone loop, moving youth user balances data-ready directly into BIMB Mobile before the shutdown deadline."* |
| **Product Value** | *"We show links to basic financial products that users can read about."* | *"We seamlessly cross-sell high-value institutional ecosystems (Be U Awfar Nest prize draws & Term Deposit-i accounts) by making asset locks a direct perk of gamified lifestyle achievements."* |
