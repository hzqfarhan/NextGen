# BeU NextGen

> **Be U by Bank Islam × UMPSA | Hackathon X Fintech Forward 2026**  
> Theme: *"Future of Money: Reimagine Finance with AI"*

AI-powered financial companion for youth money habits.

## Problem Statement

Students and young adults see one balance number and mentally guess what is safe to spend. That hides rent, bills, transport, food, savings goals, and end-of-month pressure inside the same number — causing overspending, missed commitments, and financial anxiety.

## Our Solution

BeU NextGen separates money into **what the user has**, **what must be protected**, and **what can be safely spent**. The NextGen AI Council turns risky money moments into quick, understandable decisions with a local Malaysian voice and practical next steps.

> Core question: *"Can I afford this right now without hurting my future self?"*

                 ├─ Google Gemini AI (structured JSON responses, function calling)
                 └─ PostgreSQL Database (users, savings, transfers, bills, chat_logs)
```
