# BeU NextGen

AI-powered financial companion for youth money habits.

## Overview

BeU NextGen is a light-mode-first financial wellness app that helps youth spend smarter, save better, and understand money before it becomes a problem.

It is built around one practical question:

> Can I afford this right now without hurting my future self?

## Problem Statement

Students and young adults often see one balance number, then mentally guess what is safe to spend. That hides rent, bills, transport, food, savings goals, and end-of-month pressure inside the same number.

## Our Solution

BeU NextGen separates money into what the user has, what must be protected, and what can be safely spent. The NextGen AI Council then turns risky moments into quick, understandable decisions with local Malaysian youth voice and practical next steps.

## Key Features

- Smart Bill Lock
